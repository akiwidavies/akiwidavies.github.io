<p>When the name Christadelphian was adopted by Dr. Thomas as “a denominational appellative” for the Body, to satisfy State requirements during the American Civil War, the Doctor in his certificate, on behalf of the brethren seeking exemption from military service, included the following statement:</p>
<p>“The denomination … conscientiously opposes and earnestly protests against ‘Brethren in Christ’ having anything to do with politics in wordy strife, or arms-bearing in the service of the sin-powers of the world under any conceivable circumstances or conditions whatever; regarding it as a course of conduct disloyal to the Deity in Christ, their Lord and King, and perilous to their eternal welfare.”</p>
