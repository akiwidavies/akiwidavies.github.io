<p class="First">THE VAST MAJORITY of the Central (or Amended) Christadelphian ecclesias in the English-speaking world use as their basis of fellowship what is commonly called the <i>Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith</i>, or BASF for short. Many other associated groups use it too, sometimes with additions to the section headed “Doctrines to be rejected.” Some use a document that they claim as ‘the original statement of faith,’ which will be referred to below; but it is most certainly not ‘the original.’ Many ecclesias have their own statement of faith; but all Central Fellowship ecclesias, at least nominally, assent to the use of the BASF for inter-ecclesial fellowship, and it is commonly announced as the basis at Bible Schools in North America. This is because there is another, quite large group <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote29">1</a> that uses a slightly different statement, which, among several other changes, does not include the 1898 amendment described below. It is also worth remembering that probably more than half the world’s Christadelphians today are not English-speaking, so mission workers use other literature encapsulating the same truths.</p>

<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">The role of John Thomas (1805–1871)</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">John Thomas (‘Dr Thomas,’ as he is often known) developed the distinctive foundational beliefs of our community over many years, roughly from 1833 to the 1860s. I outlined what I then knew of the development of his views in my book <i>John Thomas, His Friends and His Faith</i>, published in 2003. It is generally acknowledged that Brother Thomas’s mature views are reflected in the <i>Synopsis of the One Faith</i>, <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote30">2</a> published in June 1869 during his final visit to Great Britain. <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote31">3</a></p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note30">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">2</span> See the Appendix.</p>
</div>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note31">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">3</span> The <i>Synopsis</i> was published on the inside front cover of <i>The Revealed Mystery</i> in 1869; but it is also referred to in the 1867 <i>Ambassador of the Coming Age</i> (vol. 4, p. 160) as appearing on the back cover of a pamphlet called <i>Important Correspondence</i>, published in Chicago in 1867.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1903 Brother C. C. Walker, writing about the <i>Birmingham (Amended) Statement of Faith</i>, commented as follows on its relationship to Brother Thomas’s <i>Synopsis of the One Faith:</i></p>
<p class="Quote">“Dr. Thomas, many years ago, gave us in <i>The Revealed Mystery</i> his summary of the Christianity revealed in the Bible. This we accept as good and true, and believe the Birmingham Statement to be in harmony with it.” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote32">4</a></p>

<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Robert Roberts (1839–1898)</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">Brother Roberts was a prolific writer who started setting down his doctrinal views quite early in life, but essentially following the beliefs of Brother Thomas. He first delivered his <i>Twelve Lectures</i> (later retitled <i>Christendom Astray</i>) during the winter of 1861–2, when he was only in his twenties. It was around this time that, with the advent of the American Civil War, Brother Thomas suspended his magazine, <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote33">5</a> and subsequently encouraged Robert Roberts to publish a magazine for the community in Britain. <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote34">6</a> In the first issue Brother Roberts published “The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ,” and in 1868 his ecclesia in Birmingham moved from a small schoolroom on Ann Street to the much larger Athenaeum Hall on Temple Row. Beside the signboards suspended on two sides of the building advertising the “Christadelphian Synagogue, Athenaeum Hall,” two painted tablets were placed on the outer entrance doors, upon which were inscribed “the positive and negative features of the One Faith.”</p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note33">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">5</span> The <i>Herald of the Kingdom and Age to Come</i> ceased publication in December 1861.</p>
</div>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note34">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">6</span> Robert Roberts published the first issue of the <i>Ambassador of the Age to Come</i> (subsequently renamed <i>The Christadelphian</i>) in July 1864.</p>
</div>
<p>Soon after this, Brother Roberts produced what is believed to have been the growing ecclesia’s first printed statement of faith, which was distributed to all members. This is referred to on the inside front cover of the <i>Ambassador</i> for January 1868. It can be argued for at least two reasons that this is “the original” Christadelphian statement of faith:</p>
<ol>
<li>it was the first statement published under the name ‘Christadelphian’ <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote35">7</a></li>
<li>it was the first such statement to be published by Robert Roberts, who wrote virtually every phrase of every succeeding version for almost the next thirty years.</li>
</ol>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note35">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">7</span> In its published form it describes itself as a statement “upon which the Christadelphian Ecclesia of Birmingham is founded.”</p>
</div>
<p class="After-Bold">It is important to note that this was an <i>ecclesial</i> statement: it was embodied in a document called <i>The Record of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia containing the names and addresses of the brethren and sisters</i>, and it was a few years before the statement itself was widely adopted by others. <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote36">8</a> Meanwhile, several ecclesias produced their own statements; but all those that I have seen are similar. One of the London ecclesias had published one in 1867, <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote37">9</a> but as it was written under the aegis of the ‘Immersed Believers’ (the name used by the original supporters of John Thomas in Great Britain, but from whom Brother Roberts, and Brother Thomas himself, separated in 1866) it is perhaps not surprising that it had little traction.</p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note36">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">8</span> The first ecclesia to adopt the statement outside Birmingham seems to have been Swansea (<i>Christadelphian</i>, vol. 13, no. 143, May 1876, p. 192).</p>
</div>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note37">

</div>
<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">The statement of 1868</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">The 1868 <i>Record of the Birmingham Ecclesia</i> contained the names of the members (ninety-two at that time), the names of the various officers, and the constitution of the ecclesia, as well as its Statement of Faith. A sample of Section 3 of the Statement, concerning the nature of man, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Quote">“<b class="SemiBold-Italic">III DISOBEDIENCE OF ADAM.</b> That Adam broke this law and was adjudged unworthy of immortality, and sentenced to return to the ground from whence he was taken (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Gen.%203.15-19" data-reference="Gen. 3.15-19" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Gen. 3:15-19</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Gen%203.22" data-reference="Gen 3.22" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">22</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Gen%203.23" data-reference="Gen 3.23" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">23</a>), in which sentence all mankind are involved, as the propagation of Adam’s being (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rom.%205.12" data-reference="Rom. 5.12" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rom. 5:12</a>).”</p>
<p class="After-Bold">Owing primarily to a controversy which arose in 1873, however – which is discussed below – this clause was modified in subsequent editions, for example:</p>
<p class="Quote">“<b class="SemiBold-Italic">III. DISOBEDIENCE OF ADAM.</b> That Adam broke this law and was adjudged unworthy of immortality, and sentenced to return to the ground from whence he was taken, in which sentence, all mankind are involved” (1871).</p>
<p class="Quote">“<b class="SemiBold-Italic">III. DISOBEDIENCE OF ADAM.</b> That Adam broke this law, and was adjudged unworthy of immortality, and sentenced to return to the ground from whence he was taken – a sentence carried into execution by the implantation of a physical law of decay, which works out dissolution and death, and while a man is yet alive, gives him, where it is left to its uncontrolled operation, a tendency in the direction of sin. This is the law of sin in the members, spoken of by Paul, which the new law established by the truth brings into subjection. In Adam’s sentence, all mankind are involved, in consequence of their being physically derived from his physically-affected and unclean being” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote38">10</a> (1877).</p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note38">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">10</span> Though not included here, both the 1871 and the 1877 editions included the relevant biblical references. In 1871, the references were printed at the end of the text, while the 1877 edition used a series of numbers in the text to refer to the relevant Bible passages in a parallel column.</p>
</div>
<p class="After-Bold">The section on “Doctrines to be rejected” is interesting because, like all the succeeding versions prior to 1883, the 1868 Statement included Bible references at the end of the text, for example:</p>
<p class="Quote">“<b class="SemiBold-Italic">XVIII. – THE ‘ETERNAL SONSHIP’ OF CHRIST.</b> That Jesus was not co-eternal and co-equal with the Father, but was created of the Father, by operation of Holy Spirit upon Mary: a mortal man, partaker of flesh and blood, having no pre-existence, made in all respects like unto his brethren; yet, through the moral and intellectual energy derived from his paternity, without sin (<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Luke.%201.35" data-reference="Luke. 1.35" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Lk. 1:35</a>; <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%201.20" data-reference="Matt. 1.20" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Mt. 1:20</a>; <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rom.%208.3" data-reference="Rom. 8.3" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rom. 8:3</a>; <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Heb.%202.14" data-reference="Heb. 2.14" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Heb. 2:14</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Heb%202.17" data-reference="Heb 2.17" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">17</a>; <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Heb%204.15" data-reference="Heb 4.15" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">4:15</a>).”</p>
<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Successive editions</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">It is not known how frequently updated editions of <i>The Record of the Birmingham Ecclesia</i> were issued, but they appeared in at least 1871, 1873, 1875, 1877 and 1879. <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote39">11</a> There were some changes between editions, but the bulk of the statements remained the same, although the layout changed.</p>

</div>
<p>The clauses given above as examples were not, in fact, chosen at random: they illustrate the most disruptive incident in the brotherhood during the 1870s. In 1873 Edward Turney, a former Methodist Minister who became a prominent Christadelphian, ‘renounced’ the community’s standard view of the nature of Christ. <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote40">12</a> This produced a torrent of literature, and prompted the clarifications to the statements of faith produced after this time. The biblical references, however, remained unaltered. This illustrates the fact that most of the changes to the Statement of Faith were caused by internal disputes within the community on the meaning of certain parts of Scripture.</p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note40">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">12</span> For further details of what became known as ‘Renunciationism,’ see: Reg Carr, “The Doctrine of the Atonement: the Christadelphian experience,” <i>Testimony</i>, vol. 54, no. 637, Jan. 1984, pp. 1–8.</p>
</div>
<p>But not all the erroneous ideas promulgated by brethren caused changes to the Statement of Faith. In 1894, for example, Robert Roberts published a list of sixteen topics, on all of which some had erred in opposite directions. There were, for example (quoting Brother Roberts),</p>
<p class="Quote">“5. Men who have taught that Christ had a ‘free’ life and a nature uncontaminated by the curse of Eden, asserting that his nature was clean, holy, and immaculate, and men who have gone to the other extreme, and contended that he was a ‘sinner in Adam.’” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote41">13</a></p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note41">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">13</span> <i>Christadelphian</i>, vol. 31, no. 365, Nov. 1894, p. 435.</p>
</div>
<p class="After-Bold">As it happens, both these extremes are covered, directly or indirectly, in our Statement of Faith. But some are not covered at all. Quoting Brother Roberts again, there were</p>
<p class="Quote">“2. Men who taught the Apocalypse was all future, and men who held it was all past.” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote42">14</a></p>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note42">

</div>
<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Significant changes</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">The disputes and revisions that occasioned clarifications in the Statement of Faith are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edward Turney and his ‘free life’ theory. Also known as ‘Renunciationism,’ this was associated with what came to be known as ‘clean flesh,’ although this term was not used until around 1904. This controversy occasioned major changes to the 1877 statement, and the clarifications made can be clearly seen in the 1883 revision.</li>
<li>The document containing the 1883 Statement of Faith was completely recast from the <i>Record of the Birmingham Ecclesia</i>. Now entitled <i>The Truth in the Nineteenth Century, or the lessons of thirty years’ experience, presented in the form of a guide to the formation and conduct of Christadelphian ecclesias in the varied circumstances in which they came into existence, in the age in which we live</i>, <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote43">15</a> the new document consisted of the following sections:
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note43">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">15</span> Subsequently known as the <i>Ecclesial Guide</i>, and still available from the Christadelphian Office.</p>
</div>
<ol class="Alpha">
<li>“The Truth to be Believed”</li>
<li>“The Doctrines to be Rejected”</li>
<li>a new addition, “The Commandments of Christ,” with an introduction: Class 1, nos. 1–20, “Commandments difficult to obey,” and Class 2, nos. 21–53, “Not easy, but less difficult.” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote44">16</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note44">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">16</span> In this edition, there were no Scripture references in any of the three sections.</p>
</div>
<li>In December 1885, the Birmingham Ecclesia split, prompted by a disagreement about how to handle those who believed in the partial inspiration of the Bible. With a majority of the ecclesia’s arranging committee against him, Robert Roberts formed a new ecclesia, meeting in the same location, and revised its constitution, publishing a new edition in 1886. This edition
<ol class="Alpha">
<li>added, to the front of the Statement of Faith, a “Foundation Clause” covering the inspiration of the Bible</li>
<li>added the following clause to the doctrines to be rejected: “1. That the Bible is only partly the work of inspiration – or, if wholly so, contains errors which inspiration has allowed”</li>
<li>removed old clause 5 (“That Christ was of a different nature from other men”) from the doctrines to be rejected</li>
<li>added Scripture references to The Truth to be Believed (but not to the Doctrines to be rejected). The ecclesial records show that this was against the wishes of Robert Roberts, who wanted the Statement to be a declaration of the Truth, not a set of proof texts</li>
<li>added the current clauses 32–35 to the Doctrines to be rejected. It is possible to demonstrate that these were all added because of contemporary problems. They dealt with refusing some meats because of the Law of Moses, British Israelism, recovery of debts, and politics/military service (or our relationship with the state)</li>
<li>added references to “The Commandments of Christ,” and removed the introduction and the division into two classes (although the text was hardly altered).</li>
</ol>
<p>Other minor changes were made to that part of the document dealing with ecclesial organisation and operation.</p>
</li>
<li>An amendment was made in 1898 as a result of a disagreement between Brother Roberts and Brother J. J. Andrew of London. The difference of view was mainly over what was actually accomplished by baptism into Christ. Brother Andrew held the view that baptism was the ground, or basis, of resurrection, while Brother Roberts maintained that the ground of responsibility to judgment was ‘light,’ or a knowledge of the truth about God’s will. In view of this, Brother Roberts suggested that Clause 24 might be reworded to define responsibility to judgment more clearly. In the end, it was the Birmingham Ecclesia which voted to introduce the amendment defining those who were responsible (“namely, those who know the revealed will of God, and have been called upon to submit to it).” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote45">17</a></li>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note45">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">17</span> There is some dispute as to whether Brother Roberts was entirely in favour of the change.</p>
</div>
<li>The Berean division of 1923 had its roots in the years after the First World War, in a prolonged dispute between the Birmingham Ecclesia and the Clapham Ecclesia about the issue of special constables and whether any brother who joined should be automatically disfellowshipped. Yet even before those who formed the Berean Fellowship left, the Birmingham Ecclesia inserted the phrase “or as police constables” in doctrine to be rejected no. 35, after the words “That we are at liberty to serve in the army.” <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote46">18</a></li>
</ol>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note46">
<p><span class="Ref-Number">18</span> This amendment was passed by resolution of the Birmingham Ecclesia in October 1917 (see: <i>Christadelphian</i>, vol. 56, no. 666, Dec. 1919, pp. 559–61).</p>
</div>
<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">Summary and conclusion</h4>
<p class="After-Bold">The Christadelphian Statement of Faith was clarified and amplified over about fifty years in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with Robert Roberts building on the foundation of John Thomas, by issuing:</p>
<ol>
<li>a series of personal and ecclesial statements</li>
<li>a series of statements, originating in 1868, published in <i>The Record of the Birmingham Ecclesia</i>, that were reworded several times over the next decade <a class="Ref" id="Testimony1072-Footnote47">19</a></li>
<div class="Pop" id="Testimony1072-Note47">

</div>
<li>the <i>Guide to the Formation of Christadelphian Ecclesias</i> (1883), which was Brother Roberts’s ‘how to’ treatise for the growing community. In the process of so doing, he reorganised the Statement of Faith while preserving the same doctrines. The 1883 statement was subsequently modified in two ways after the major division of late 1885, and a reissue in 1886: first, by a major ‘amendment’ in 1898; and, secondly, by a very minor change in 1923. Since that time, this statement, now widely known as the BASF, has been adopted by most Christadelphian ecclesias in the English-speaking world, and has become the ‘touchstone’ of the community, as the statement of its settled principal beliefs.</li>
