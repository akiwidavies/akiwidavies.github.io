<p>Sister Mrs. Davis has suffered the loss of her husband by death. He was not meeting with us at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Brother Edgar Round has removed to Lichfield, where he will find fellowship in the little community which, under the shadow of the ancient cathedral, holds forth the truth that Christendom has so long forsaken.</p>
<p>Brother Richard Sheppard died during the month at an advanced age (over 70 years). He was to have been buried at Witton, on Wednesday, 18th April, by the Police Force, to which he at one time belonged. Relations would not suffer the brethren to come near.</p>
<p>Brother Viccars Collyer was with us on March 25th, addressing us in the morning at the breaking of bread and lecturing in the evening on “Light in the Darkness.” With the exception of a cold with which he successfully grappled, he seemed well and in good spirits, and his visit was much enjoyed.</p>
<p>The Easter Monday Tea Meeting was held on the 22nd, according to programme. Many were away on holidays; but there were many visitors. The list of names has unaccountably vanished. The meeting after tea had matter furnished by the readings from <span class="Ref:Numbers 35"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Num%2035" data-reference="Num 35" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Numbers 35</a></span>. and <span class="Ref:John 8"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John%208" data-reference="John 8" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">John 8</a></span>. The cities of refuge and Christ as the Light of the world and the bringer of freedom from the slavery of sin. A profitable time was spent, as must always be the case more or less where the Bible is placed at the top of everything.</p>
<p>Brother A. T. Jannaway served the truth here on April 15th, delivering the morning exhortation and lecturing in the evening on “Abraham: friend of God and Heir of the world.” He said privately to the Editor that coming to Birmingham he felt somewhat like going to address a lot of schoolmasters. The reply was that probably nowhere else would he find such a lot of truly sympathetic and appreciative brothers and sisters. He spoke enthusiastically of our father Abraham, and prospects and conditions of co-inheritance.</p>
<p>Brother Charles Smith and sister Nellie Smith were united in marriage on March 8th. They were not related at all in the flesh. This is the third sister Nellie Smith in the meeting, but there is no confusion. The other two changed their names in marriage. By the way, they have lately found the name Smith on the monuments, in Greek characters, if we remember rightly, somewhere in Egypt. So that it can boast of a high antiquity. But the ambitions of those passing by that name among us seek inscription in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
<p>We have been visited during the month by brother Sheppard, Leamington; brother Viccars Collyer, Leicester; sister Lomas, Halford Bridge; brother and sister Todd, Leeds; brother Purkis, Tamworth; sisters Lizzie and Margaret Bruce, Union Hall, Jersey City, U.S.A.; brother and sister A. T. Jannaway, and brother and sister Purser, London; brother J. Butler, Grantham; brother Forest, Crewe; brother and sister J. Chandler, Bourton-on-the-Water; brother and sister Shuker, Shrewsbury; brother and sister Wood, and brother and sister Wood, junr., Oldham.</p>
<p>An overheard conversation, between a brother and a sister: The brotherapparently fault-finding. <em>Sister:</em> Have you read this month’s (March) Sunday Morning exhortation? <em>Brother:</em> No, I have not. <em>Sister:</em> You have the book? <em>Brother:</em> Yes. <em>Sister:</em> Then you read it. It is by brother Roberts. It is beautiful. I think I never read anything like it in my life. It seems like a voice from the dead. I don’t know whether it was because it seemed to fit me more particularly or not. However, you read it, I feel sure it will do you good. (The sender of this, who heard the conversation, thought that this sister’s kindly way and remarks was worthy of being echoed to distant lands.)</p>
<p>The usual quarterly meeting was held on April 3rd, minutes of the arranging brethren’s proceedings and statements of accounts being submitted. They showed a fairly satisfactory state of affairs, except as to one or two points. We were financially sound, and active in the dissemination of the truth. Some enquiries were made as to Temperance Hall rebuilding projects, but no further information was forthcoming. Enquiries were also made as to the action of the Arranging Brethren in removing brother Shuttleworth’s name from the list of Presiding and Arranging brethren, and substituting brother G. M. Lamerton (presiding) and brother B. Warrender (arranging). It was elicited in reply that the brethren, after long forbearance, and with extreme reluctance, had acted under Sec. 29 of the constitution, because of brother Shuttleworth’s intemperance. The ecclesia accepted the recommendation of the Arranging Brethren, and withdrew from sister Mrs. Samuel Walker, who has forsaken the assembly.</p>
