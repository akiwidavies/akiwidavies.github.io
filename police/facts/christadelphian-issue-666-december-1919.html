<span class="SmallCaps">Statement</span><br>
</h4>
<p>At the Annual Business Meeting of the ecclesia, held October 9th, 1919, the brethren and sisters whose names are appended were withdrawn from for reasons given in the following statement: </p>
<p>At our business meeting in October, 1917, certain minutes of the Arranging Brethren relating to two brethren who had joined the Constabulary were before the ecclesia. These minutes were to the effect that, as service in the Constabulary is inconsistent with the commands of Christ, we should have no alternative but to withdraw from them unless they obtained their release.</p>
<p>An amendment was moved by a brother as follows: </p>
<p>That no action be taken for the present upon those parts of the Minutes which relate to brethren L. and M. and the position of Special Constables generally.</p>
<p>This was seconded, and supported by a few brethren.</p>
<p>After lengthy discussion the matter was brought into concrete form by the following resolutions, which were passed with very few dissentients: </p>
<p>That we agree now, as we have done for more than thirty years past, that the Commandments of Christ cited as appended to our Constitution, prohibit the resistance of evil, the avenging of ourselves, and the doing of violence, and that therefore the duties of a police constable or a soldier are incompatible with our position as Christadelphians.</p>
<p>That in Clause 35, under the heading “Doctrines to be rejected,” we insert after the words “in the army” the words “or as police constables.”</p>
<p>The minutes of the Arranging Brethren were then confirmed and the matter thus definitely closed.</p>
<p>The brethren moving the amendment do not justify service in the Constabulary, would not join themselves, and do not recommend any brother to do so, but strongly advise to the contrary.</p>
<p>In a personal statement made by brother Davis at the Quarterly Meeting, July 10th, 1919, he supported this by the following remarks; also agreed to by brother Pearce: </p>
<p>“I have never justified service in the Constabulary, nor do I do so now. I say that any brother who joined would be very foolish. If I knew anyone who proposed doing so, I would do my utmost to dissuade him.”</p>
<p>Their personal feeling was that the brethren in question could not “be accused of sinning ‘a sin unto death.’” They do not deny any of the commands of Christ, loyally submit to the voice of the majority, and accept the position of the ecclesia.</p>
<p>A dissatisfied minority refused to recognise that the matter was now closed, and at subsequent Business Meetings made repeated attempts to re-open the matter against the voice of the ecclesia. Several Business Meetings were, in consequence, disorderly, and the work of the truth was hindered.</p>
<p>The minority issued an “Open Letter” dated January 1st, 1919, in which they contended that the mover and seconder of the amendment of October, 1917, should be withdrawn from. The open letter is untrue in substance and detail. A special meeting of the ecclesia was called to deal with it on January 30th, 1919, when the reply of the Arranging Brethren was approved, and ordered to be printed. In the matter of Military and Constabulary Service, the ecclesia took the right course and do not approve of all things said by the accused brethren, as the minutes show: but the ecclesia did not and does not consider them worthy of excommunication for “views” which the minority attribute to them, but which they do not really hold.</p>
<p>Upon the refusal of the Arranging Brethren to re-open the matter, about 27 brethren and sisters sent in their resignations, which the Arranging Brethren were compelled to refuse as being unconstitutional. The minority refused to cancel their resignations, and established a separate and hostile meeting for the breaking of bread. As efforts for reconciliation failed, the arranging brethren were compelled to recommend the ecclesia to withdraw from them.</p>
<p>At the Quarterly Ecclesial Meeting, July 10th, 1919, the very small vote of the meeting was against this recommendation, resulting in the extraordinary position of breaching the Constitution (Clause 5) and apparently voting to retain in fellowship, a minority who accuse us of sin, and will not fellowship us.</p>
<p>After fully considering the matter, the Arranging Brethren called a special meeting of the ecclesia, to which the following statement was presented: </p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Dear Brethren and Sisters</span>, – It is with regret that we have to refer to the circumstances that have arisen in the ecclesia which necessitate your executive calling this special meeting.</p>
<p>The decision taken at the last Quarterly Meeting (July 10th), which was very confused and disorderly, resulted in our Constitution being breached and left us as a body without constitutional authority. Under these circumstances your executive, namely, twelve arranging brethren, finance brother, assistant finance brother, recording brother, and assistant recording brother feel that they must tender their resignations, so that the ecclesia can re-adjust itself and re-affirm its Constitution. After stating our reasons for this action, brother C. C. Walker will vacate the Chair, and leave the meeting open to appoint its own chairman.</p>
<p>We do not dispute that the vote rejecting the Arranging Brethren’s recommendation to withdraw from certain brethren and sisters was constitutional, and we now lay before you the result of that vote and the reasons for our action.</p>
<p>1. The ecclesia is divided, and if two cannot walk together unless they be agreed, much less can one thousand or more.</p>
<p>2. The refusal of the ecclesia to disfellowship the minority retains in fellowship those who will not fellowship us, and who accuse us of sanctioning doctrines inconsistent with the commandments of Christ. It does not follow, however, from this that the meeting is prepared to re-open the discussion. An abnormal situation is thus created.</p>
<p>3. The decision apparently approves the disorderly action of a minority in maintaining a separate and hostile meeting.</p>
<p>4. The Constitution has been breached by refusing to deal with those who will not submit to it. (Rule 5.) The present situation does not come within the scope of Rule 32. The assembly through their Arranging Brethren does not tolerate the rejection of any element of the truth of the gospel, neither do the accused brethren deny any of the commands of Christ.</p>
<p>5. The decision also supports the untrue allegations of the minority that the two brethren A.D. and T.E.P. hold false doctrine, and that the ecclesia should ask them unreservedly to withdraw their views, or alternatively that the two brethren should be disfellowshipped – a disorderly proceeding.</p>
<p>That the two brethren do not hold these erroneous views was plainly demonstrated by brother A.D. at the last Quarterly Meeting, when, stating his position, he categorically denied the salient points of the accusing circular, and asked the dissatisfied brethren to accept this and cancel their letters of withdrawal. In this denial, brother Davis only stated in public what had long been known to the Arranging Brethren and which formed the basis of their action. Means had also been taken to acquaint the minority with these facts. This was also confirmed by brother Pearce.</p>
<p>At the Quarterly Meeting (July 10th), the representatives of the minority absolutely refused to accept the public statement of the two brethren. We add the following extract from a letter written by brother Pearce: “Leaving those things that are behind, what is my attitude now? As whatsoever is not of faith is sin, I should not join the Army or Police, and strongly recommend brethren to have nothing to do with either. Since my speech the Constitution has been altered by the ecclesia, and, as long as I remain in the ecclesia I intend to bow to the judgment of the majority and refrain from any further opposition to withdrawal from any brother who joins the Police.”</p>
<p>The charges by the minority against the Arranging Brethren are as follows: </p>
<p>1. Unconstitutionally refusing to accept their withdrawals from fellowship.</p>
<p>2. Unconstitutionally refusing them a special meeting under Clause 33 of the Constitution, to consider the cause of their separation on the basis of their letter of withdrawal dated Feb. 24th, 1919</p>
<p>Before dealing with these points, we wish strongly to emphasise two facts.</p>
<p>1. At the Special Meeting held on Jan. 30th, when the Arranging Brethren reviewed the whole circumstances of this question, in reply to the open letter issued by brethren V. Hall, A. Parish and C. Davis, the matter was again finally and definitely closed, by the ecclesia accepting the report of the Arranging Brethren which was ordered to be printed and circulated.</p>
<p>2. That their call for a special meeting of the ecclesia dated March 21st, also their withdrawals from fellowship, dated from April 4th, were subsequent to the above final closing.</p>
<p>In justice to you as an ecclesia, we could not allow a dissatisfied minority to over-ride your decisions and enforce their disobedient attitude.</p>
<p>As regards Clause I. The reasons given for withdrawal from fellowship were stated to be set forth in their letter of Feb. 24th, 1919. This letter refers first of all to the “open letter” issued by brethren V. H., A. P., and C. D., which had been dealt with and settled as stated above. It also charged the Arranging Brethren with refusing to allow the ecclesia to carry out suggestions made in the “open letter”; suggestions that the ecclesia never expressed any wish to follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, it reiterates charges against brethren A.D. and T.E.P. which have been proved untrue. We could not therefore constitutionally accept withdrawals based upon such premises. To have done so would be to consent to the charges being true, whereas to refuse was quite constitutional. Neither could your executive allow a matter to be re-opened which the ecclesia had definitely closed at the Special Meeting of Jan. 30th, 1919.</p>
<p>As regards Clause 2, the answer to Clause 1 covers this. In addition, the application implies a charge that the assembly knowingly sanctions doctrines inconsistent with the commandments of Christ, which accusation, as stated before, had been proved untrue. Again it was quite constitutional to refuse the application dated March 21st.</p>
<p>The Arranging Brethren place these facts before you with a full realisation of the gravity of the situation. It now remains for the ecclesia to rectify its position and uphold its own Constitution.</p>
<p>After the election of a brother as Chairman, the following resolutions were passed almost unanimously: </p>
<p>That we, the members of the Temperance Hall ecclesia in Special Meeting assembled do accept the statement of the Arranging Brethren setting forth the Constitutional line of action they have followed in dealing with this trouble: and are satisfied from the explanation of brethren Davis and Pearce that they do not hold the views erroneously attributed to them by a certain number of the brethren and sisters.</p>
<p>Having arrived at a decision on this matter, we now ask the brethren and sisters who have tendered their resignations to withdraw the same, and to resume fellowship. Failing compliance with this request the ecclesia withdraws from them at the next quarterly meeting without further discussion.</p>
<p>It having been shown that the Constitution has been breached by the decision taken at the last Quarterly Meeting, we now re-affirm our acceptance of the Constitution and ask the Arranging Brethren to resume office pending the election in October.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, several of the minority wrote letters withdrawing their resignations and resumed fellowship with us; but an informal document consisting of a copy of a resolution purporting to be signed by 18 of them was received, containing incorrect statements, on account of which the document could not be accepted by the Arranging Brethren. They were exhorted to make their letters in accordance with the resolutions of the ecclesia, but did not do so.</p>
<p>The ecclesia passed the minutes of the Arranging Brethren regarding this regrettable matter at their Quarterly Meeting, Oct. 9th, 1919, and the brethren mentioned are therefore withdrawn from.</p>
<p>We are glad to say that this ecclesia has fully maintained the correct attitude as regards service in the Army and Police Force, notwithstanding all that has been published to the contrary by the brethren who now cease from our fellowship.</p>
<p>We regret the necessity of publishing these matters concerning brethren who have been in our fellowship. For nearly two years we have been silent, while misleading reports have been circulated throughout the country. As these reports have apparently obtained some credence, we now deem it our duty to make known the true facts. – <span class="SmallCaps">J. Fred. Smith</span>, Recording Brother.</p>
