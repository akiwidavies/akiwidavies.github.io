<p>In <em>The Christadelphian</em> for November, 1914, p. 502, under the heading “Special Constables,” a brother who had been approached by the Chief of Police stated his case, and the various forms of advice he had received from brethren. Upon these he asked our opinion. There were three pieces of advice. We dismissed the first and second as inadmissible, and gave a qualified assent to the third. This was the third piece of advice: </p>
<p>“3. – To be prepared to serve as a civil servant, while protesting against the use of arms for the taking of life. Do no violence to any man, and use judgment and discretion while keeping the peace of the district.”</p>
<p>Upon this we remarked: </p>
<p>“No. 3 seems to be the best advice. Under compulsion it would appear that a brother might rightly take the course suggested rather than incur imprisonment or whatsoever penalties might be imposed … ”</p>
<p>We wish to withdraw these remarks, because a brother taking up the position must contract, on oath expressed or implied, to do violence if and when necessary. The question has been put to a Chief Constable by a brother who was asked by a Tribunal to serve as Special Constable. “If there was a riot, would arms be served out, and should I be required to use them?” The answer was “Certainly.” Whereupon the brother declined to serve, and was permitted to perform other work of national importance. In the remarks above referred to we have, in fact, assented to the advice of the impossible. We regret this assent, and request readers to delete the wrong answer.</p>

<em>November</em>, 1917.</p>
<p>[The subjoined has been submitted to, and approved by, the Arranging Brethren, who request publication in <em>The Christadelphian</em>. – <span class="SmallCaps">Ed</span>. <em>C</em>.]</p>
<p>At the present time we, as a Committee, think it well to endorse and supplement recent circulars issued by the London Standing Committee by calling the attention of the brethren to the following facts: </p>
<p>In February, 1916, a meeting was held of the single brethren in Birmingham who were at that time affected by the Military Service Acts, at which the following resolution was passed by a considerable majority: </p>
<p>“That having discussed the question of Munition Making, this Meeting recommends the brethren for the future to seek work which is beneficial to the community at large, and which does not produce weapons for the destruction of human life.</p>
<p>“While we do not regard work which does not produce instruments of destruction as illegitimate merely because it ministers to the human needs of soldiers and sailors, it is expedient to seek occupation furthest removed from Military work.”</p>
<p>On August 24th, 1916, at a Meeting of the Military Service Committee, the following resolution was passed: </p>
<p>“That we do not recommend or advise any brother to obtain work in munition factories.”</p>
<p>We recognise the great difficulties that exist concerning employment, particularly in large manufacturing and engineering centres such as this.</p>
<p>We further recognise that many brethren have been working on munitions since before the date of the Military Service Acts.</p>
<p>We do not advise brethren whose occupation has received the approval of the Committee on Work of National Importance and the Tribunals, to make any change, but we do advise that wherever possible brethren who have the opportunity to change their occupations should find work as far removed as possible from the direct making or handling of weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>We agree that liberty of conscience must be allowed; but – in view of the fact that in the eyes of the world it is unseemly and inconsistent; and also that many young brethren have been refused exemption from Military Service because they were employed in making munitions; – we consider it advisable that brethren, as a matter of expediency, should choose occupations which give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. The Committee will render what help they can towards this end.</p>
