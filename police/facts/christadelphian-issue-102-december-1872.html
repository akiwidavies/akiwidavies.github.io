<span class="SmallCaps">Aberdeen</span>. – Bro. A. Robertson, writing October 20th, reports the obedience of <span class="SmallCaps">John Sutherland</span>, a young man who, having studied in the Grammar School, was about to enter the University, but has had to abandon his purpose through failing health. He is brother to the William Sutherland mentioned in the Grantown intelligence for October. Brother Marr has concluded his review of the “Rev.” Mr. Stewart’s sermons on natural immortality. There was a fair attendance throughout, and mostly the same faces. Brother Marr is to follow up the effort with lectures on the several items of the one faith. On a recent Sunday, brother Reid, of New Pitsligo, visited and lectured. There was an attentive audience. Subjects: “How and when the saints are to come into possession of their inheritance (the earth.)” Some are interested.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Birmingham</span>. – On Nov. 11th, <span class="SmallCaps">Rebecca Wood</span> (20), sister to sister Wood, of Fazeley, was immersed at the Athenæum Rooms, in the presence of a company specially convened. She will be an addition to the Fazeley ecclesia.</p>
<p>During the past two months, a measure has been adopted which the increase and widely-scattered homes of the brethren had rendered necessary, and which seems likely to lead to better results than even were contemplated. The town has been divided into ten districts, and in each district a brother has been requested to have a care of the rest, in the matter of visiting, in case of absence, sickness and want, and other matters, which would not come under the cognizance of the general body. In addition to these objects, some of the districts have, of their own accord, organized themselves for the promotion of the truth in their own especial parts of the town, and for a mutual drawing closer together than is possible in a large ecclesia. For these purposes, monthly meetings, in the house of the district visiting brother, have, in some cases, been resolved upon. Nothing resolved upon is to interfere with the meetings or operations of the general ecclesia.</p>
<p>During the last month there have been especially large audiences at the Temperance Hall. The hall has been filled every Sunday evening. The publication of weekly bills and advertisements is found to answer well. A feature during the last few nights has been the illustration of the lectures with charts and diagrams. The Dr.’s charts of the prophetic times of Damel and John (a large set specially drawn for him by brother Bingley); diagrams of the Nebuchadnezzar’s image and Daniel’s four beasts; also a goat and ram, also the beasts of the apocalypse; brother Donaldson’s large, beautiful and comprehensive chart of God-manifestation; also brother Bingley’s chart illustrative of the moral bearings of the same subject were all laid under contribution.</p>
<p>The subjects have been as follow: </p>
<p>
<em>Sep.</em> 29<em>th</em>. – “Dear meat and cheap bread – current complaints – their reasonableness and origin – the true cure – the price and the prospect – hard work and good times coming.” Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>
<em>Oct.</em> 6<em>th</em>. – “Ecce Homo:” “Behold the Man.” Brother Shuttleworth.</p>
<p>
<em>Oct.</em> 13<em>th</em>. – “Religious Atheism  –  the Atheism of so-called ‘Evangelical Religion’ and its identity with the doctrines and practices of Rome.” Brother Shuttleworth.</p>
<p>
<em>Oct.</em> 20<em>th</em>. – “Mr. Dawson’s allegations against the writmgs of Moses considered. – the writings of Moses and the prophets demonstrated to be the exclusive dictates of inspiration and the testimony of Jesus.” Brother Meakin.</p>
<p>
<em>Oct.</em> 27<em>th</em>. – “Looking out – danger ahead – stormy sky – angry waters – sunken rocks – big ships and little ships – waiting the pilot  –  near the haven  –  blessed hope.” Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 3<em>rd</em>. – “The Licensing Bill – publicans and sinners – Mr. Bruce’s Measure: its provisions faulty – the “interests” of the publicans and the “rights” of working men: the coming law for both not the Maine Law.” Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 10<em>th</em>. – “Seeing and hearing.” – God’s instructions to men: sundry times and divers manners – Moses: the tabernacle and its ordinances – Daniel: events and times – Jesus: the Father’s voice and presence – John in Patmos: things shortly to come to pass.” Illustrated by charts. Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 17<em>th</em>. – “God and man. – Man placed upon the earth  –  of the earth earthy  –  disobedience and death – God’s manifestations; not three, but many; in Eden; to Abraham; to Jacob; to Moses, at the Bush, and over the merey-seat in the tabernacle – Israel in the days of John the Baptist – the seed of David according to the flesh – the Word made flesh – the Son of God, not the Son incarnate but the Father incarnate – the High-Priest touched with the feeling of our infirmities.” Illustrated by a chart. Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>Between these two lectures, viz., on Nov. 22, a knife was plunged in the Editor’s heart by the death of a charming son of four years, called after Dr. Thomas. <a id="Footnote17" class="Ref">17</a> Unusual intelligence, frankness, manliness and docility, wilh personal comeliness, and physical development in a high degree, had endeared him to many, but above all to his father, who found in him a pillow of comfort in the bitterness of the battle. The blow is crushing. Only one consolation is available – that the Father cannot err. He reigns; without him a sparrow cannot fall. He doth not willingly afflict, but designs good in everything (even the sorest evil), to those who are the called according to his purpose. He gives and takes away and remains blessed for ever, giving us the hope that at the last, all curse shall cease. and the cruel sorrow of the night be forgotten in the day of glory, for which present suffering is an essential preparation. But oh, the cup is bitter, and the heart bleeds. The chastisement is “grievous.” The “afterwards” may heal the wounds. “Evil,” rather than good is our rightful portion at the hands of Him by whom all things consist, and to it we must bow if the heart breaks in the act. We are of yesterday and – nothing! God is all. Exalted is He above all blessing and praise. He has made us to hope in his great mercy notwithstanding our earthy feebleness and unworthiness. Blessed be His name, if all flesh perish. – <span class="SmallCaps">Editor</span>.</p>
<div class="Pop" id="Note17">
<p>Sorrow upon sorrow! His sister, two years old, called after sister Thomas, has, since the above was in type, died of the same disease.</p>

<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 24<em>th</em>. – “Prophecy and History – Daniel the prophet; wise and true; a captive at Babylon  –  Nebuchadnezzar’s dream  –  revelation thereof to Daniel  –  the interpretation – the king’s other dream – the tree, and the times, and the meaning – visions to Daniel himself – the four empires that have been – the Roman chaos that now is, and the kingdom and age to come.” Illustrated by diagrams. Brother Roberts.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Cranwick</span> (near Driffield). – Brother Geo. Sanderson on removing to this from Hull, introduces himself to knowledge. He came originally from Scarborough, where he became acquainted with the truth, by hearing a lecture delivered there by the Editor, on the kingdom of God, some years ago. He associated for a time with the brethren at Searborough, but is now alone, which he regrets.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Grantown</span>.  –  Brother McIntosh reports the obedience, on Sunday, November 9th, of <span class="SmallCaps">John McGillivray</span>, who was introduced to the truth through contact with brother Hood, of Tain, previous to which, he was rapidly drifting toward infidelity. Brother McGillivray is police-constable of Tain, and would like to change his occupation. He would be grateful to anyone procuring him suitable occupation. Brother McIntosh says he is intelligent, and apparently well-educated. He was disposed to defer his obedience to the truth in baptism till he should get other employment, but the brethren exhorted him not to delay on that account, but to obey first, and arrange afterwards.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Devonport</span>. – Brother Dashper reports the immersion of <span class="SmallCaps">Ann Treliven</span>, formerly Methodist; <span class="SmallCaps">Eliza Hoskins</span>, wife of brother Hoskins, formerly Episcopalian.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Fazeley</span>. – See Birmingham.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Hindlow</span>. – See Sale.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Keighley</span>.  –  Brother Dugdale reports three immersions, which, in the absence of convenience at Keighley, took place at Halifax, on Sunday, November 10th. The persons obedient were <span class="SmallCaps">John Shuttleworth</span> (22), formerly Baptist, intending before the truth found him, to enter the Baptist ministry; <span class="SmallCaps">Emily Butterfield</span> (24), formerly Church of England; and Mrs. <span class="SmallCaps">Ellen Silverwood</span>, formerly Baptist. Brother Dugdale says the day was specially interesting, both to those who put on the blessed name and those who had to welcome them to the position it introduced them to. He adds that more are enquiring, and in a hopeful way. By a sister’s kindness, large numbers of pamphlets have been distributed, and many are reading.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Leicester</span>. – Brother Weale announces the obedience of Mr. <span class="SmallCaps">John Smither</span>, husband of the sister of that name, recently obedient, whose name was mis-spelt Smithers. Brother Smither was formerly an Independent, though not a “church member.” He was immersed on the 30th of October. Brother Weale says there is an increasing interest in the truth in Leicester, as evinced by improved attendance on Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Liverpool</span>. – The meetings at Liverpool, on the occasion of the Editor’s visit, were not large, though held in a fairishly-large place (Hope Hall) and well advertised. For one thing, the weather was unfavourable. Liverpool is a little like London as regards its immensity, making it difficult to convene a meeting that is not of general public interest. However, duty was done, and perhaps the day of account may disclose something accomplished for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">London</span>. – Brother Andrew reports the following immersions: Oct. 27th: J. H. <span class="SmallCaps">Glover</span>, formerly neutral; Oct. 30th, <span class="SmallCaps">James Daniels</span>, formerly Baptist.</p>
<p>The subjects of lecture during the last month have been as follow: </p>
<p>
<em>Oct.</em> 27<em>th</em>. – “The gathering of the firstfruits unto God and the reaping of the harvest of the earth at the second appearing of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 3<em>rd</em>. – “Egypt’s past and present debasement contrasted with her future elevation and regeneration when under the universal sceptre of the Messiah.”</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 10<em>th</em>. – Watchman, what of the night! What are the signs of Christ’s coming and the end of this age?”</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 17<em>th</em>.  –  “Congregationalists and Christadelphians, or the truth vindicated in reply to an attack by the Rev. Clement Clemance, of Nottingham.”</p>
<p>
<em>Nov.</em> 24<em>th</em>. – Socinianism and materialism no part of Christadelphian faith.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Manchester</span>. – Brother Wareham reports the obedience of <span class="SmallCaps">Maria Wainwright</span> (64), mother of Sister Wainwright. She was connected with the Campbellites for twenty years.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Nottingham</span>.  –  Arrangements are in progress for opening the new synagogue, on Sunday, December 1st. The sister Barley spoken of in the October intelligence, ought to have been sister Bailey. Brother Mycroft, writing November 15th, reports three further additions, viz: in September, Miss <span class="SmallCaps">Sarah Ann White</span> (26), daughter of sister Sarah White; and, this month, <span class="SmallCaps">John Henry Boot</span> (17), son of brother and sister Boot; and <span class="SmallCaps">John Wyer</span> (19). Sister Hannah Holmes emigrated to Greenville, Pennsylvania, on Monday, September 23rd. Brother and sister Phelps having remained away for a long period, a special meeting, to which both brother and sister Phelps were invited, decided that the managing brethren had done all in their power to induce a return; consequently nothing remained but to recognise withdrawal as accomplished.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Oswestry</span> (North Wales). – Bro. Sulley, of Nottingham, lived here for the best part of three years. Knowing the people, and believing there were among them such as have a zeal of God not according to knowledge, he was anxious the truth should be presented to them. Accordingly, arrangements were made conjointly with Birmingham, for the Editor to give three public lectures in the place. The meetings took place on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, November 6th, 7th, and 8th, in the Public Hall, Oswestry. Clerical endeavours had been made to prevent the people from attending, but this was only a partial success the first night, when (the weather being also unfavourable) only about sixty persons attended. Next night, a much larger number were present, and on the third night, there was quite a large audience. There were questions (and these of the earnest sort) at the close of each lecture except the last. Brother Sulley occupied the chair and at the close of each meeting, distributed tracts at the door, as the audience dispersed. The subjects of lecture were, first, “Christendom in the light of apostolic prediction;” second, “The New Testament doctrine of eternal life as affected by the doctrine of natural immortality;” and third, “The Lord’s second appearing and the signs of its approach.” There were some cases of real interest, as evinced by the purchase of works.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Sale</span>. – Writing on the 15th of November, brother W. Birkenhead reports the immersion (into the saving name) of <span class="SmallCaps">Joseph Slack</span>, of Hindlow, near Buxton, Derbyshire. The event took place on Sunday, October 20th, after which, brother Slack united with the Sale brethren, in commemorating the Lord’s death. It is after a long period of study and investigation that brother Slack has placed his feet in the narrow path which leadeth unto life. Also of Mr. (now brother) <span class="SmallCaps">Booth</span>, of Sale, formerly Church of England, who has cast in his lot with the sect everywhere spoken against, first being buried in water for the remission of sins, on the evening of Saturday, October 26th. “We may venture to hope,” says brother Birkenhead, “that he may soon be cheered on the way by the obedience of his partner in the joys and sorrows of this period of weakness and suffering.”</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Swansea</span>. – Brother Goldie reports that on Nov. 2nd <span class="SmallCaps">Thomas Rees</span> (37), formerly a Campbellite, was immersed into the saving name. He had held advanced views for a long time, through contact with the brethren, but his removal to another part of Wales for a time stopped his progress. “On Thursday, November 14th, a tea-meeting was held, at which a number of brethren from Mumbles and Llanelly were present, as well as a considerable number of strangers. Addresses were given by several brethren, and a very pleasant and profitable evening was the result. We are also about to commence a Sunday school, as we have now a large number of children amongst us.”</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Tain</span>. – See Grantown.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Tewkesbury</span>. – On Wednesday and Thursday, November 20th and 21st, brother J. J. Andrew, of London, lectured twice on Mr. Warleigh’s recent lectures on “the extinction of evil persons and evil things” – Mr. Warleigh is a local clergyman, who it will be recollected has come out against eternal torments on clerical grounds. Bro. Andrew’s lectures were intended to show that the Bible was on the side of the position taken up by Mr. Warleigh.</p>
