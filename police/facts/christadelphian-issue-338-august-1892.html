<p>You remember that some fifteen months ago, I reported that we had examined a sergeant of police, who had shown good knowledge of the things of the kingdom and the name of Christ, but who, at the last moment, put off his immersion. He has now renewed his application, expressing his sorrow that he had put off so long. He was connected with “the (Plymouth) brethren,” and had strong influence brought to bear upon him to deter him from submission to the truth. It had been a fearful time for him, almost distracting him. Happily, he has overcome. On June 26th he requested us to immerse him, which we gladly proceeded to do, giving God thanks for His long-suffering and tender mercy. Thanks be to God! We buried him in water for the remission of sins, and for a union with Christ’s name. His age is 57. He also said that his faith in the things of the kingdom and the name of Christ is even stronger now than it was when he was examined in March, 1891. During the interval, he had searched the Scriptures to try and find some consolation in remaining away from us, but the more he searched the more unrest he experienced, and he resolved to remain away no longer. There is another whom we have examined, who proved to be satisfactory, and will (if the Lord will) be immersed in due time.</p>
