<p>THIS is a time of trial, and the blessing contingent upon endurance unto the end is bound up with the memory of Christ’s commandments and an honest endeavour to obey them. In the matter of service as special constables and in other ways, brethren are being specially tried, and the following extract from <em>Christendom Astray</em>, Lecture 18., is reprinted as a reminder of our position as Christadelphians, and as an inducement to maintain the position so clearly and emphatically defined, and so long and faithfully held by the body: </p>
<p>“Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. Of him that taketh thy goods, ask them not again. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain” (<span class="Ref:Matthew 5:39-41"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%205.39-41" data-reference="Matt. 5.39-41" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 5:39-41</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Luke 6:30"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Luke%206.30" data-reference="Luke 6.30" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Luke 6:30</a></span>).</p>
<p>Of all the commandments of Christ, this of unresisting submission to legal and personal wrong is the one that most severely tests the allegiance of his disciples, and which accordingly is most decisively neglected in all Christendom.</p>
<p>It would not be too much to say that it is deliberately refused and formally set aside by the mass of professing Christians, as an impracticable rule of life. That it stands there as the plainest of Christ’s commandments, cannot be denied; and that it was re-echoed by the apostles and carried out in the practice of the early Christians, is equally beyond contradiction. Yet, by all classes, it is ignored as much as if it had never been written. To what are we to attribute this deliberate disobedience of all ranks and classes of men, nominally professing subjection to Christ?</p>
<p>Something of it is doubtless due to a wrong conception of the object of the commandments. It is commonly imagined that the commandments of Christ supply, and are intended to supply, the best modes of life among men – that is, those modes that are best adapted to secure a beneficial adaptation of man to man in the present state of life upon earth. Doubtless they would prove such if all men acted on them. But in a world where the majority ignore them and act out their selfish instincts without scruple, it is otherwise. They expose the obedient to personal disadvantage.</p>
<p>They were never intended to have any other effect. They were intended to develop “a peculiar people,” whose peculiarity should consist in the restraint of natural impulse in submission to the will of God. They were designed to chasten and discipline and purify such a people by the exercise of patient submission to wrong in preparation for another time when such commandments will be no longer in force, but when it will be given to the developed and obedient saints to “execute judgment” upon the ungodly, and “break in pieces the oppressor” as a preliminary to the blessing of all people (<span class="Ref:Revelation 2:26"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%202.26" data-reference="Rev. 2.26" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 2:26</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Daniel 7:22"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Dan.%207.22" data-reference="Dan. 7.22" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Dan. 7:22</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Psalm 149:9"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Ps.%20149.9" data-reference="Ps. 149.9" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Psa. 149:9</a></span>).</p>
<p>Men say society could not be carried on if these principles were acted on. Such a speech is not the speech of a disciple. Christ is not aiming at carrying on society on its present footing, but at “taking out a people” to carry it on rightly – that is, on divine principles – in the age to come. His own case illustrates the position. The people wanted to take him by force and make him a king, but he withdrew (<span class="Ref:John 6:15"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John.%206.15" data-reference="John. 6.15" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jno. 6:15</a></span>). A man wanted him to interfere in a will dispute. He declined, saying, “Who made me a judge and a divider” <span class="Ref:Luke 12:14"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Luke%2012.14" data-reference="Luke 12.14" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Luke 12:14</a></span>? His part was to testify the truth, to do the will of the Father, to do all the good he could on divine ground, and as for the world, to “testify of it that the works thereof were evil” (<span class="Ref:John 7:7"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John.%207.7" data-reference="John. 7.7" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jno. 7:7</a></span>). In this course, he created hatred for himself, which finally took the form of personal violence. This violence he did not resist. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter; his life was taken from the earth. And he said, with regard to his whole experience, “The disciple is not greater than his Lord. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you” (<span class="Ref:John 15:18"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John.%2015.18" data-reference="John. 15.18" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jno. 15:18</a></span>).</p>
<p>Christendom resists evil; sues at law; resents injury, brandishes the constable’s truncheon, and fights in the army, even if the men it is called upon to shoot are fellow Christians. If pointed to the law of Christ, it shakes its head. It speaks of “duty to society,” “the protection of life and property,” and the certain chaos that would set in if the law of Christ were in force. In this, Christendom speaks as the world, and not as “the church,” because it is not the church, but the world. The true church is composed of the brethren of Christ; and he tells us that his brethren are those who obey his commandments, and do the will of the Father, as expressed by his mouth (<span class="Ref:Matthew 12:50"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%2012.50" data-reference="Matt. 12.50" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 12:50</a></span>; <span class="Ref:John 12:49"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John.%2012.49" data-reference="John. 12.49" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jno. 12:49</a></span>, <span class="Ref:John 12:50">50</span>).</p>
<p>The question for such has no difficulties. The question is: “Does the law of Christ allow them to employ violence under any circumstances?” If not, the loss of life itself would not be a consequence to be considered by them. Thoughts of expediency or philanthropy are out of place when urged in defence of doing that which the law of Christ forbids. If riots must rage unless we disobey Christ, let riots rage. If life and property must be exposed to the ravages of wicked men, unless we do that which Christ tells us we are not to do, let all houses and all lives be unprotected. If we must incur and pay heavy penalties, unless we choose to break the law of God, let the penalties be paid. If we must be killed, and all our families with us, unless we forfeit the approbation of the Lord and Master, and lose eternal life at his coming, let us die at once.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to hamper the question of duty with any secondary consideration whatever. The time has not come for the saints to keep the world right. It has to be made right before even keeping it right can be in question. The position of the saints is that of sojourners on trial for eternal life. God will take care that their probation is not interfered with by murder and violence before the time. The matter is His. We are in His hands: so is all the world. We need not therefore be distressed by thoughts of what will be the effect of any course required by Christ. He will take care that His work comes out right at last. The simple and only question for us is that which Paul put near Damascus: “Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?” We may not do what involves disobedience to Him.</p>
<p>A special constable, for example, is required if need be, to break a man’s head with a truncheon. The question in such a case is, therefore, best put thus: “Does Christ allow his servants to break people’s heads with truncheons?” It is not a proper answer to this question to say that being commanded to obey magistrates (<span class="Ref:Titus 3:1"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Titus%203.1" data-reference="Titus 3.1" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Titus 3:1</a></span>), we are bound to act as special constables if the magistrates order us; because no one will deny that this exhortation is governed by the larger precept, that we are to “obey God rather than man” (<span class="Ref:Acts 4:19"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Acts%204.19" data-reference="Acts 4.19" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Acts 4:19</a></span>). No candid person will contend that Paul meant we were to obey magistrates when their order might be to disobey God. If any such contention is made, it is a sufficient answer to cite the practice of the apostles, who must be allowed to be reliable interpreters of their own exhortations.</p>
<p>They were constantly disobeying magistrates in the particular matter of preaching the gospel, and brought themselves to prison and death by this disobedience. There was no inconsistency between this course of theirs, and their exhortation to “obey magistrates;” for in the matters referred to in this exhortation, they were themselves obedient to magistrates. They paid tribute, honoured the ruling powers, and recognised the authority of the law, in all matters not affecting their allegiance to the law of God. This is a duty required of all saints, and cheerfully rendered by them, notwithstanding that they expect all such orders and institutions to be abolished in due time. That time is the Lord’s time; and for this they patiently wait. The work is the Lord’s work, and for Him they wait.</p>
<p>But are they to be induced or coerced by human law to do what Christ has expressly forbidden? The only question is, has he forbidden what is in question in this case? Has he forbidden violence? As to this, nothing is clearer, “<em>He ha’h left us an example that we should tread in his steps</em>” (<span class="Ref:1 Peter 2:21"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/1%20Pet%202.21" data-reference="1 Pet 2.21" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Peter 2:21</a></span>). This is what Christ himself said to his disciples: “I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you” (<span class="Ref:John 13:15"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/John%2013.15" data-reference="John 13.15" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">John 13:15</a></span>). Now what is the example of Christ as to the matter in hand? The testimony is that <em>he did no violence</em>, neither was deceit found in his mouth (<span class="Ref:Isaiah 53:9"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Isa%2053.9" data-reference="Isa 53.9" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Isaiah 53:9</a></span>). As Peter tells us, “When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously” (<span class="Ref:1 Peter 2:23"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/1%20Pet%202.23" data-reference="1 Pet 2.23" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Peter 2:23</a></span>).</p>
<p>Such is the teaching that has been so widely current among us in the past, and is as widely current now. It is undeniably scriptural. As to the question of fellowship in case of unfaithfulness on the part of brethren, the following is from <em>The Christadelphian</em> for 1898, December, p. 530, and is an answer to a correspondent by the late editor, though published shortly after his death.</p>

<h4 style="--fontSize: 24; line-height: 1.5;" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36px" class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated">The Office of a Constable in the Truth</h4>
<p>“Would you fellowship a brother holding the office of constable?” – L. A.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Answer</span>. – Not if he taught rebellion against the Lord by contending that a brother might lawfully thrust at another with a cutlass, or knock a man down with a truncheon, or kill him in self-defence. If, being found by the truth in a constable’s office, he accepted and strove to obey the prohibitions against personal violence imposed by the truth, seeking peacefully to exercise the harmless duties of his office, duty and mercy would require his recognition at the hands of the brethren, leaving the Lord to judge the doubtful part of the case. A brother joining the police-force would be in a different position. He would go into the snare with his eyes open, and would rightly forfeit the approbation of his fellow-believers, and incur the possible condemnation of the Lord. The office of police-constable involves the employment of personal violence. In this respect, it is on a footing with the calling of a soldier. Our duty in relation to both must be determined by the more general question of whether the servants of Christ are permitted to use force in either the punishment of evil doers, or the protection or vindication of themselves. For if they are not allowed to do this for themselves, it cannot be that they are at liberty to do it for others, as in the case of a soldier or policeman who is hired. But the truth may find a man a soldier or a constable. What is he to do? If he can leave the service or the force, let him do so, and find his livelihood in ways more consonant with the calling wherewith he has been called. If he cannot, let him at least, in his calling, act on the principle of absolute harmlessness which belongs to the present Lamb-stage of our heavenly vocation. He will be disqualified for some of the duties of his office, but it may be that in the kindness of God, he may never be called upon to perform them.</p>
<p>The foregoing has our entire approval, and during the last twenty years we have occasionally answered a similar question in equivalent terms and on the same scriptural basis. An anomalous situation now threatens to arise. On the one hand brethren are refusing the office of special constable when required by the magistrates to take it, and being penalised for that refusal; and on the other hand, brethren are voluntarily accepting the office of special constable on one or other of the various pleas rehearsed in the extract from <em>Christendom Astray</em>. Although the cases on either hand are few, the situation is there and must be faced. It will be observed that the foregoing “Answer” couples military service with the police-force. As regards the law of Christ concerning violence there is practically no difference between the two. A brother might as well be in the army as be a special constable.</p>
