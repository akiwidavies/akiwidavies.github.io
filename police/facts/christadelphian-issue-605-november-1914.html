<p>H. R. writes: “The head of the Police Force in this district has approached me to volunteer as a special constable. Upon my expressing a desire <em>not</em> to volunteer, he warned me that the authorities had power to call suitable persons for service and that, if summoned, I should have to go, and do my part for the public good. Upon introducing the subject for consideration and advice from the brethren I have had presented various ideas: </p>
<p>“1. – To absolutely refuse to serve, and sell or leave my business and remove from the district.</p>
<p>“2. – To serve in the public interest and good, and, if necessary, be prepared even to shoot a poisoner of water, or any such enemy acting as a danger to the whole community. And between these two extremes:</p>
<p>“3. – To be prepared to serve as a civil servant, while protesting against the use of arms for the taking of life. Do no violence to any man, and use judgment and discretion while keeping the peace of the district.</p>
<p>“The foretold time of trouble is upon us, and if not taken from the scene by the call of Christ, undoubtedly we shall be in many ways affected and tested in our faithfulness to the principles of the truth.</p>
<p>“A word or two of guidance expressed through <em>The Christadelphian</em> to the brethren in general would, I am sure, be appreciated.”</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Remarks</span>. – No. 1 is bad advice. To follow it would only be to create more difficulty; and to secure no exemption. As a matter of fact, a similar trouble is reported from the other end of the kingdom from that of our correspondent.</p>
<p>No. 2 is wicked advice. The law of Christ does not permit us to shoot men. Some brethren are enlisting in the army under the influence of patriotic appeals to the “righteousness” of this war, and so forth. Suppose they kill some of their brethren on the other side. What will they say to the Lord in the day of judgment? It is to be hoped that upon second thoughts none of H.R.’s Christadelphian advisers will really counsel the killing of one’s enemies!</p>
<p>No. 3 seems to be the best advice. Under compulsion it would appear that a brother might rightly take the course suggested rather than incur imprisonment or whatsoever penalties might be imposed. No doubt there are great difficulties, and brethren will be condemned by brethren from very different points of view. It will be well for all to remember their responsibility is to the Lord, and to act accordingly.</p>
