<p>AFERTILE source of loose thinking among “orthodox” Christians is a devotion to a very limited selection of texts. We Christadelphians rather pride ourselves on our comparative immunity from such a failing; and certainly the contention has a good foundation in the habits of certain speakers, who, “for connection,” read far beyond the required verse both backwards and forwards. Certainly no one compares scripture with scripture more than the Christadelphian – no one excels him in searching far and wide for support for his beliefs. As a result, generally speaking, those beliefs, fitly framed together, form a beautifully consistent whole.</p>
<p>Logic and consistency are, unhappily, not by any means so noticeable in our conduct and rules of conduct. Actions are good, bad, and indifferent. Some are commanded, others forbidden; those neither commanded nor forbidden, directly or indirectly, are to be analysed as to expediency, possible causes of stumbling, and, above all, as to our motives in desiring to do or refrain from doing any such action.</p>
<p>How are actions judged? Why are certain courses of conduct proscribed? By reference to carefully-considered principles based on the letter and spirit of the law of Christ? Sorrowfully, I must answer, “Frequently no.” Honestly no doubt, but none the less inimically, many brethren judge by reference to phrases which by misuse have become meaningless jingles – mere catch-words. Here are a few examples: “Not of the world,” “be ye separate,” “doubtful disputations,” “lusts of the flesh,” “an integral part of an organisation kept for the special purpose of  … ” The fact that four of the five are in the words of scripture does not make their misuse any more excusable. Here are typical questions so often “settled” by reference to catch-phrases: Alcohol, smoking, theatres, cinematographs, concerts, other “amusements” or “pleasures” (such as fishing, boating, motoring), holiday-making, improvement of worldly position, saving money, insuring one’s life, marrying and giving in marriage, membership of friendly societies, trade unions, employers’ associations, tradesmen’s associations, clubs, charitable societies, councils, or committees.</p>
<p>The time-honoured method of judging such questions is to condemn those we dislike, or have been taught to disagree with, or are prejudiced against by placing them on one of the “black lists” labelled <span class="SmallCaps">pleasure, things after which Gentiles seek, things the world does</span>, etc. And this notwithstanding that other actions which we like, or have always regarded as allowable, or are prejudiced in favour of, are equally comprehended in the condemnatory headings.</p>
<p>Let us know upon what <em>principles</em> we base our actions. Let us ask ourselves a few plain questions, <em>and answer them</em>.</p>
<p>Are all things which the “Gentiles” seek, or “the world” does, necessarily to be condemned? If so, stick to the principle you have laid down, and eschew all these things, even those pleasures and practices called harmless by much-to-be-pitied “weaker” brethren. But if not, and you are convinced that a specific action (whether “Gentiles” do it or not) is harmful, then cease from “claptrap,” and bring forth your strong reasons. Show with quietness, moderation, and gentle firmness <em>how</em> it is opposed to the spirit of Christ’s commands.</p>
<p>Is co-operation with “sinners,” “the world,” “Gentiles,” “Cæsar,” forbidden? Then be logical – condemn business partnerships with outsiders; do not co-operate with “Cæsar” by accepting any Government contract; do not co-operate by working in Cæsar’s Post Office, Cæsar’s Employment Exchanges, or Cæsar’s Customs; be not conformed to the world even by judging the prize vegetable patch; for surely after all these things do the Gentiles seek!</p>
<p>We are told that no true brother of Christ can be in the Army <em>in any capacity</em>. And why? Because he would be “an integral part of an organisation kept for the special purpose of fighting.” Ask and answer this: “Is it a principle that a brother cannot be a unit of an organisation if its objects are those which are forbidden to the brother himself? Must a brother who is unwilling to make munitions consequently refuse to be part of any munition-making organisation, no matter what work he actually performs? Is it necessarily wrong to work for a firm (perhaps I had better say to be part of an organisation) whose principal object is the acquisition of riches – an object clearly inconsistent with the faith of Jesus Christ? Surely the answer is in the negative.</p>
<p>Surely if relieved from the necessity of taking the Army oath, or from the liability to transfer to any other unit, a brother joining the R.A.M.C. would be carrying out many commands of Christ, and violating none. What of the brethren who as civilians are assisting whole time or part time in hospitals for wounded soldiers? Are they any less part of the Army organisation? are they any less co-operating with Cæsar because they wear no khaki and draw nothing from the Army Vote? I saw in the Press a long account of the tribunal case of a conscientious objector who stated he would obey no military order, but in cross-examination expressed willingness to dig trenches in France if orders were given by a civil policeman. Such is the logical result of illogicality. (The conscientious objector was a Christadelphian.)</p>
<p>We are to be in the world, but not of it. The command is that we should be different from, not secluded from, others. We can be physically “in the world,” but must not be in our hearts “of the world.” Jesus ate and drank with publicans, and yet was “separate from sinners.” He was the friend of publicans and sinners, yet he kept unspotted from the world. It is the taint, not the company, of the world which we must avoid. This is <em>not</em> impossible if our heart is regenerate, and our treasure in heaven. If we are to keep from the world lest we be spotted, how are we the salt of the earth? Is the salt to be kept apart from the meat? Is the leaven of the kingdom to be isolated from the lump?</p>
<p>We <em>ought</em> to mingle with the world <em>for the world’s sake</em>. Are we salt without savour, or leaven without virtue, that we should fear the contact? Yet there is a danger. The man with ten talents ran a risk not shared by the servant who kept his talent “separate.” The danger is our lack of faith and incomplete union with divine things. Fully equipped, harmless as doves, but wise as serpents, we may boldly enter the den of lions. The lions of the world will not devour the faithful brother, who will at last be able to say with Jesus, “I have overcome the world.”</p>

<span class="SmallCaps">Remarks on the Foregoing</span><br>
</h4>
<p>We publish the foregoing, not because we agree with all its sentiments, but because it contains some wholesome criticisms. We surmise that “Publicanus” is a brother who finds himself in the position described in <span class="Ref:Matthew 18:17"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%2018.17" data-reference="Matt. 18.17" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 18:17</a></span>, and that because of his joining the R.A.M.C. If this be so, then we are doubly sorry – first that he has taken this step, and next that, having taken it, it should be felt necessary on that account to “let him be as a heathen man and a publican.” Perhaps, however, we err in the interpretation of the actual position.</p>
<p>His little opening thrust over “for connection” will find us all out more or less. The Editor confesses that it has gone “between the joints of the harness” in his case, and that he frequently drags in more than is critically necessary. Who does not? Only inspiration itself is above reproach in this particular.</p>
<p>Though “Publicanus” generously recognises “a beautifully consistent whole” in the main Christadelphian position, as is inevitable, he is constrained to complain that there is sometimes – nay, “frequently” – inconsistency in judgment, however “honest” it may be. This is perfectly true; and our main object in publishing this article is to inculcate caution, breadth of view, and faithfulness to Christ combined. “Show with quietness, moderation, and gentle firmness <em>how</em> (such and such a course) is opposed to the spirit of Christ’s commands.” So says P., and he is entitled to an answer.</p>
<p>Absolute consistency and logicality is not found in flesh and blood. The Lord alone was faultless, and even he was misjudged on all hands. Some of the things that P. suggests ought to be done, have been done, and are being done, as when he says: “Be logical – condemn business partnership with outsiders.” But these have not been condemned to the point of excommunication. Who can get out of Cæsar’s service in some form or other? Some time ago a brother wrote a very “naughty” letter to a newspaper against munition-making, being at the same time himself employed in a branch of a great munition works! And some time ago a handful of brethren in an excess of zeal to eliminate smoking, almost risked setting the sanctuary on fire in the consequent strife. They would tolerate smoking in B., C., and D. ecclesias, down to Z., but not in A. ecclesia, which seemed to indicate that “prejudice and principle” had become confused. Even P. does not seem to be wholly consistent when he asks whether civilian brethren (serving in hospitals) “are any less part of the Army organisation than those that have joined the R.A.M.C.”? To our mind they are “outside the Army,” which is unquestionably the best place for brethren. When P. says, “We ought to mingle with the world,” he surely cannot mean, “We ought to enter the Army.” No doubt Daniel survived in the den of lions; but he did not go in there of his own free will. We sincerely hope “Publicanus” will survive, and presently resume unclouded fellowship as “Frater noster.” – <span class="SmallCaps">Ed.</span>

<p>TO pay taxes is a Christadelphian’s duty (<span class="Ref:Matthew 22:21"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%2022.21" data-reference="Matt. 22.21" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 22:21</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Romans 13:7"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rom.%2013.7" data-reference="Rom. 13.7" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rom. 13:7</a></span>). That the money collected should be used for the creation, equipment, and upkeep of fighting men, in no way lessens the obligation. “Pay,” says Paul, and he speaks in a manner that should remove all scruples in regard to the military consideration. The apostle, too, does not say that we are to shut our eyes to the way in which our money is expended. Nor does he argue that tax-paying is permissible because part of the money goes for street-paving or sewer-making. On the contrary, he particularly fixes our mind on the sword, and says that our tribute is towards its maintenance. He explains the place the sword occupies in the divine arrangements. He tells us that sword-bearers are ordained by God; that they are a necessity for the government of the world; and that, as a result of sword-bearing, the saints receive benefits: “For this cause pay ye tribute” (<span class="Ref:Romans 13:1-7"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rom.%2013.1-7" data-reference="Rom. 13.1-7" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rom. 13:1-7</a></span>). The difficulties which some experience on this subject arise from wrong conceptions respecting the use of force – through placing the world and the Church on a level as to its employment. Although Christ’s disciples are not allowed to use force, they are allowed, nay, enjoined, to help the powers-that-be in their work of maintaining order by means of the sword. To contribute, as nonbelligerents, money and labour for the needs of army, navy and police, is not unlawful. But they dare not fight. Some brethren are willing to contribute money and not labour. Let us be slow to judge or condemn one another in this matter, as was Dr. Thomas (see <em>The Christadelphian</em>, May, 1917, p. 194).</p>
<p>How often can a Sunday School scholar, with his knowledge of the elementary principles of Bible revelation, answer promptly and correctly questions which baffle and defeat hoary-headed philosophers. Our thoughts go back to an excited crowd of scientists, in the room of the Geological Society, London, in 1913. The question under discussion was: “Did man reach his modern estate in mind and body during the Pleistocene period – one or two hundred thousand years ago, or is the antiquity of self-conscious, circumstance-adapting man of much greater antiquity?” The Bible (which would have settled the point in two seconds) was not appealed to, but <em>Eoanthropus Dawsonii</em> (the Piltdown skull) was. What a shock the professors would have had if only <em>Eoanthropus</em> could have spoken! The incident reminds one of a skit which was published in the palmy days of Darwin. The picture (from memory) was that of a patriarchal leader of a Scientific Research Society, on the seashore, eloquently expatiating, to a party of admiring ladies, on the amazing and bewildering antiquity of a well-worn, salt-water-crusted boot, when to the surprise of both speaker and hearers, an old salt, who had been watching the proceedings from afar, shouted out that he had had his eye on them for some time, and he would thank them to leave his property alone, and get out of it.</p>
<p>Again the newspapers are advertising the wild guesses of scientists respecting the Piltdown skull. The revival of the subject is due to the death of Mr. C. Dawson, the finder of it. Once more we are told that this poor little relic is two hundred thousand years old, and that it is that of a female, midway between ape and man – that this skull throws great light on human ancestry, and affords positive proof of the doctrine of evolution. What must the Great Creator think of such talk, especially after having inspired Moses to reveal clearly and simply the origin and modest age of the race (<span class="Ref:Genesis 2:7"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Gen.%202.7" data-reference="Gen. 2.7" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Gen. 2:7</a></span>: <span class="Ref:Genesis 3:19">3:19</span>), and also after having moved Christ and the apostle Paul to confirm and amplify the account (<span class="Ref:Matthew 19:4"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%2019.4" data-reference="Matt. 19.4" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 19:4</a></span>; <span class="Ref:1 Corinthians 15:45"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/1%20Cor.%2015.45" data-reference="1 Cor. 15.45" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Cor. 15:45</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Acts 17:26"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Acts%2017.26" data-reference="Acts 17.26" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Acts 17:26</a></span>). However, as God suffers the blasphemy, we may rest assured that it serves a good object. It may be that it is intended to keep alive that “delusion” which He has sent on account of the world’s perverseness and ingratitude (<span class="Ref:2 Thessalonians 2:11"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/2%20Thess.%202.11" data-reference="2 Thess. 2.11" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">2 Thess. 2:11</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Isaiah 25:7"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Isa.%2025.7" data-reference="Isa. 25.7" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Is. 25:7</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Isaiah 66:4">66:4</span>). Let us take care that we do not succumb to the world’s influence, lest we share in the shame and punishment which ere long will usher out this foolish and unbelieving age (<span class="Ref:2 Thessalonians 1:8"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/2%20Thess.%201.8" data-reference="2 Thess. 1.8" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">2 Thess. 1:8</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Jeremiah 16:19"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Jer.%2016.19" data-reference="Jer. 16.19" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Jer. 16:19</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Isaiah 50:11"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Isa.%2050.11" data-reference="Isa. 50.11" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Is. 50:11</a></span>).</p>
<p>If we are the friends of God, we shall prove ourselves peace-makers, not peace-breakers. Let us meditate on the following precepts until they find a warm place in our hearts: “Seek peace” (<span class="Ref:Psalm 34:14"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Ps.%2034.14" data-reference="Ps. 34.14" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Ps. 34:14</a></span>; <span class="Ref:1 Peter 3:11"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/1%20Pet.%203.11" data-reference="1 Pet. 3.11" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Pet. 3:11</a></span>); “Live in peace” (<span class="Ref:2 Corinthians 13:11"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/2%20Cor.%2013.11" data-reference="2 Cor. 13.11" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">2 Cor. 13:11</a></span>); “Have peace with one another” (<span class="Ref:Mark 9:50"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Mark%209.50" data-reference="Mark 9.50" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Mark 9:50</a></span>; <span class="Ref:1 Thessalonians 5:13"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/1%20Thess.%205.13" data-reference="1 Thess. 5.13" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">1 Thess. 5:13</a></span>); “Follow peace with all men” (<span class="Ref:Hebrews 13:14"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Heb.%2013.14" data-reference="Heb. 13.14" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Heb. 13:14</a></span>; <span class="Ref:2 Timothy 2:22"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/2%20Tim.%202.22" data-reference="2 Tim. 2.22" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">2 Tim. 2:22</a></span>). If we do this we shall not pose as conscientious objectors to fighting whilst harbouring a bitter, contentious, quarrelsome attitude towards our brethren. “But do not the scriptures require us to ‘contend’ and ‘resist’?” They do, but let us differentiate between lawful and unlawful contention and resistance, between a righteous and an unrighteous cause, and between carnal and spiritual weapons. But at all times and under all circumstances peace must be our objective – at home, abroad, and in the ecclesia. A true saint is no wrangler – no rowdy. Rather than take part in a mere squabble, or engage in a contest for the sake of animal glory, or mere victory, he will leave the field in possession of an opponent. In the heat of a quarrel things are often said that are a disgrace to the truth – rash, illogical, unscriptural words. Let us avoid strife, and “count the cost,” before engaging in war. It is in quiet, calm, and peace, that the truth prospers, and the new man grows. That God should so constantly and impressively enforce peace is a delightful reflection. It speaks to us of His character, and augurs universal and everlasting peace at last.</p>
<p>“A great Earthquake.” This is the Apocalyptic symbol for the French Revolution (<span class="Ref:Revelation 11:13"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%2011.13" data-reference="Rev. 11.13" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 11:13</a></span>). A far greater earthquake is approaching (<span class="Ref:Revelation 16:18"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%2016.18" data-reference="Rev. 16.18" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 16:18</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Haggai 2:6"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Haggai.%202.6" data-reference="Haggai. 2.6" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Hag. 2:6</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Joel 3:16"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Joel%203.16" data-reference="Joel 3.16" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Joel 3:16</a></span>). If we would realise the horrors of the coming upheaval, let us study French history from the reign of Louis 16th to that of Napoleon Bonaparte. This is how Carlyle speaks of the events that led up to the Revolution: “The whole sky growing black with signs of hurricane and earthquake.” Let us hear his description of the Revolution itself: “An horror of great darkness and shakings of the world.” Let us again listen to the historian as he writes on the sanguinary happenings of the time: “Many are the labourers, great is the harvest. By the hundred and the thousand, men’s lives are cropt; cast like brands into the burning.” – “The notabilities of France disappear, one after another, like lights in a theatre which you are snuffing out.” All this is but a miniature representation of what will transpire in the awful catastrophe to which the world is tending. Then it will not be simply the fall of the “tenth” of the “Great City,” but the complete destruction of the whole of it (<span class="Ref:Revelation 14:8"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%2014.8" data-reference="Rev. 14.8" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 14:8</a></span>), – not merely the temporary overthrow of one monarchy, but the lasting subjugation of all (<span class="Ref:Revelation 11:15"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%2011.15" data-reference="Rev. 11.15" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 11:15</a></span>). “Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!” Truly, will men who then remain, give “glory to the God of heaven” (<span class="Ref:Revelation 15:4"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Rev.%2015.4" data-reference="Rev. 15.4" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Rev. 15:4</a></span>; <span class="Ref:Zephaniah 3:8"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Zeph.%203.8" data-reference="Zeph. 3.8" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Zeph. 3:8</a></span>, <span class="Ref:Zephaniah 3:9">9</span>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In our speech let us be influenced and governed by the scriptures, and not by the unlawful vocabulary of the world. For a brother to call another an “old fool” or a “young ass” is for him to disgrace his Christadelphian profession. Fortunately, cases of this kind are rare. There is need, however, for us all to be very careful. We live in days of wicked flippancy and growing irreverence. Bad habits, in the matter of speech, are easily contracted, and not so easily thrown off. “But some are so provoking,” it is said. This is true, but it is no reason for allowing our tongues to run riot in the use of epithets which we should expect to fall only from the lips of the sons of Belial. No one is perfect – we are all exasperating at times. But we must be forbearing and kind, and try to make allowances for each other’s weaknesses. When we are tempted to employ un-Christ-like language, we must show self-control – curb our temper, and smother, if necessary, our damaged pride. Where God’s wishes are heeded, this will be done. To resort to abuse, to swear, or to fling phrases, coined by an ungodly world, as a means of correcting or rebuking, is not God’s way. “Be courteous,” at all times, is the Spirit’s counsel. Those only who submit to this counsel, and educate themselves on the lines of it, will be permitted to lead society in the age to come. The kingdom will be no place for black-guards, whether they be such in actions or speech.</p>
<p>Christadelphians are outside the army – both from its combatant and non-combatant sections. This is the outcome of the intricate and inscrutable workings of Providence, and a reward for faithfulness. The brethren have recognised their duty, and regardless of consequences, have striven to fulfil it. The deliverance, however, has not been obtained apart from anxiety, effort, and sacrifice. The cost, in certain cases, has been severe. May God richly recompense the sufferers, which He will undoubtedly do, where the stand has been taken out of loyalty to the commands of His dear son (<span class="Ref:Matthew 5:10"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%205.10" data-reference="Matt. 5.10" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 5:10</a></span>, <span class="Ref:Matthew 5:11">11</span>). Let no one decry the value of our exemption. It is not only an escape from pains and penalties, but the continuance of an unspeakable blessing which the brotherhood, as a whole, has so long enjoyed – the opportunity to spread the truth, and to assemble to upbuild one another (<span class="Ref:Hebrews 10:25"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Heb.%2010.25" data-reference="Heb. 10.25" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Heb. 10:25</a></span>). Let us show our gratitude to God for His kindness in this business by an increased zeal in His service. Let there be no vain-glorying, or fleshly advertising, over the exceptional treatment meted out by the authorities. And let there be no envying and murmuring, although some may have been exempted on easier terms, as regards the appointed work of national importance, than others. Let us remember that God can take away as well as give. If through good conduct our favour has come; it may through ingratitude and unworthy conduct be taken away.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas, in his handling of the scriptures, was courageous and uncompromising. A more able man in this respect perhaps never lived. Neither the tears of friends nor the curses of foes, moved him from proclaiming and upholding what he believed to be the truth. He was independent, straightforward, persevering, and a clear thinker. He despised mere sentiment, and loathed hypocrisy and humbug. Throughout his long career he made the Bible his guide and master. Hear him, as a young man, when his traducers were busy: “They make a great noise, but it will end in smoke. The truth, which is not with them, will prevail.” Note his mind, when financial loss presented itself on account of the much time he was devoting to religion: “Riches are not the object of my desire. If I am enabled to live so as to die in the faith, owing no man anything but love, let my survivors remember that I die more wealthy than Crœsus.” Consider his righteous indignation when wickedly accused of a wish to found a sect: “The head of a sect! Contemptible! I leave such vanities for those whose empty heads are best pleased therewith; they have no charms for me.” Think, also, of his humility, his grateful recognition of God in the affairs of his life, and his longing for the welfare of the brotherhood, as exhibited in the homely and memorable address to the Birmingham ecclesia, twelve months before his death (<em>The Christadelphian</em>, 1870, pp. 186-191). Brethren – Elders and Leaders – “mark” this noble man, not to cast dirt at him, but to copy his Paul-like ways.</p>
<p>People will often listen to an address on the Millennium when they will not to one on Armageddon. But this must not lead us to neglect the latter subject. The alien are not good judges as to what is best for them. Both subjects have always gone side by side in the divine messages delivered through prophets and apostles. The terrors of the Lord, as much as His mercies, have an important influence in forming a robust and healthy scriptural mind. To omit Armageddon in our public ministrations is to encourage a mental lopsidedness, and to pander to manifold flesh-pleasing heresies. To do so is also to suppress a part of the divine means for sobering the frivolous and rebellious side of human nature. But we must hold the balance carefully and wisely. Too much Armageddon leads to despair and unbelief. The subject, however wisely handled, will underline the truth of the gospel, and furnish a rational explanation as to how the gospel can become a matter of fact. Many who smile the smile of incredulity when the apparently utopian blessings of the Kingdom are proclaimed, and a righteous God-fearing Israel in Palestine is pictured, wake up to the realities of the case when the 38th and 39th chapters of Ezekiel and the 16th to 19th chapters of Revelation are earnestly and skilfully expounded. Paul, as a preacher, must be our example (<span class="Ref:Acts 20:27"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Acts%2020.27" data-reference="Acts 20.27" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Acts 20:27</a></span>). If we follow him the Word will make headway.</p>

</span>. – How he enlisted at the beginning of the war, obtained a commission in the King’s Royal Rifles, and after hearing the thirtieth chapter of Isaiah read in church resigned owing to conscientious objection was told by Joseph W. Sault, an appellant at Northamptonshire Appeal Tribunal. He came to the conclusion, he said, that to fight was incompatible with Christianity, and told his colonel he must resign, even if it meant being court-martialled and shot. He returned to civil life as an employee of the Great Central Railway at a salary of £175 a year, the same sum as he had received before. Sometimes he preached, but denied that he used his influence not to enlist. The case was adjourned for a month, with a view to Sault getting work of national importance at a pecuniary sacrifice. – [It is not at all clear on a perusal of the chapter mentioned, what application the young man made of it to his particular case. Perhaps the reference was misheard by the reporter. – C. A. L. It may have been the thirty-second chapter: “The work of righteousness shall be peace” (verse <span class="Ref:Isaiah 32:17">17</span>). But the “Prince of Peace” is also “a Man of War” in his time, and by judging and making war in righteousness establishes peace based upon righteousness, prevailing to the conquest of wickedness. But all this belongs to another dispensation when there <em>is</em> a King in Israel. – <span class="SmallCaps">Ed</span>.]</p>

<span class="SmallCaps">Modern World’s Wonders</span>. – Wireless telegraphy heads the list of the modern world’s seven wonders, according to the poll of a thousand scientists in America and Europe (says the New York correspondent of the <em>Standard</em>). The remaining six, in the order named, are the telephone, aeroplane, radium, antiseptics, and antitoxins, spectrum analysis, and the X-ray. The vote was taken by the editor of the <em>Popular Mechanics’ Magazine</em>. The seven wonders of the ancient world were chosen by the Greeks before the birth of Christ. They were the Pyramids of Egypt, the Pharos of Alexandria, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, the Statue of Jupiter by Phidias, the Mausoleum of Artemisia, and the Colossus of Rhodes. The Pharos was a lighthouse 400 feet high, while the Colossus was a cast metal image not half as high as the Statute of Liberty. The modern wonders were chosen from a prepared ballot containing 56 subjects of scientific and mechanical achievement. There were also blank spaces for the insertion of any other subjects the voters might select. Wireless telegraphy got the greatest number of votes. The Panama Canal got 100 votes; anæsthesia 94, and synthetic chemistry 81, but they were far behind the winning seven.</p>

<span class="SmallCaps">Jerusalem before the War</span>. – The latest indication of the progress going on in Jerusalem was the arrival a short time ago of an American motor road-roller, and the decision to equip the city with an efficient tramway system. The walls enclose 209 acres, of which 35 acres are occupied by the Temple enclosure. But owing to the impossibility of housing the thousands of Jewish immigrants which still continue to arrive, building has been proceeding outside the walls to a very considerable extent. The consequence of the presence of this extramural population is (says the <em>American Hebrew</em>) that first one and then another of the gates was left open by night until to-day they are all perpetually open. Meanwhile the Mohammedan population is not by any means keeping pace with the Jewish, and the Holy City seems in a fair way to become once more in fact as well as name the capital city of the Hebrew race. Jerusalem is soon to have its own tramway service, as a concession for the purpose has already been granted to a French company. An English company has applied for a concession to illuminate the city with electric light, and a German syndicate wishes to provide the city with water by the construction of large reservoirs near wells situated at a distance of about sixteen miles from Jerusalem. The municipality is also considering proposals for paving the streets and constructing sewage works. A modern fire-extinguishing apparatus and a telephone installation are also to be provided. – [Jerusalem is under a cloud to-day; but will presently recover some prosperity under the Protectorate probably of Britain. But she can never know peace until her King cometh. – <span class="SmallCaps">Ed</span>.]
