<p>We have received the following letter: </p>
<p>
<em>September 22nd</em>, 1932.</p>
<p>Dear Brother Walker,</p>
<p>On behalf of the Arranging Brethren of the Temperance Hall ecclesia, I am requested to ask if you will be good enough to insert the following in the forthcoming issue of <em>The Christadelphian</em>?</p>

</h4>
<p>At a special meeting of the Temperance Hall ecclesia, the circular letter issued by the London brethren in May last was read and considered, and the following resolution was passed unanimously, viz.: </p>
<p>“That we express our hearty agreement with the conclusions and recommendations of the London brethren as set out on page two of their circular letter, understanding the terms of the Resolution to be in harmony with the Resolutions passed by the Temperance Hall ecclesia on November 1st, 1917, as follows: </p>
<p>“That we agree now as we have done for more than 30 years past, that the Commandments of Christ cited as an appendix to our Constitution, prohibit the resistance of evil, the avenging of ourselves, or the doing of violence, and that therefore the duties of a police constable or a soldier are incompatible with our position as Christadelphians.”</p>
<p>“That in Clause 35 under the heading of ‘Doctrines to be rejected,’ we insert, after the words ‘in the Army,’ the words ‘or as Police Constables.’”</p>
<p>To the terms of these resolutions we still adhere.</p>
<p>With fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>Faithfully your brother,</p>
<p>
<b>J. Fred. Smith,</b>
</p>
<p>
<em>Recording Brother</em>.</p>
