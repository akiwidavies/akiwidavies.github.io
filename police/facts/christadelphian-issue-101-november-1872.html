<p>A correspondent reports the case of two brethren who were summoned before the magistrates for enrolment as special constables, and who escaped from the obligation of the law in the matter. Their experience may be useful to others in a like predicament. We forbear mentioning the name of the place or officials concerned in the matter. The two brethren were summoned to have their names registered to act in case of necessity. There was no prospect of their services being required, but it appears to be the custom to register a certain number of citizens every year, upon whom the authorities can at once fall back in case of disturbance. Both refused. One obtained exemption without difficulty on the ground of living outside the borough; the other had no such plea to urge. Nevertheless, he determined he should not consent to what was required, even if it should involve his commitment to prison. He was brought before the mayor, and asked why he refused to serve. The mayor asked if he was a Quaker. Answer: No; but he had the same objections. Christ prohibited his servants from using violence at the present time. The mayor replied that the objector received the benefits of citizenship, and ought to discharge its duties. The brother replied that, as to that, he simply obeyed “the powers that be,” and while thankful for the privileges, at the same time, he did not aspire to the powers and honours within his reach as a citizen, and this he thought should be accepted as a set off against his refusal of the service required of him. The mayor then said coaxingly that there was not the slightest probability of his services being required, and he might very well allow his name to be entered. It was merely a matter of form. To this the brother answered that that was the very reason why his refusal, on conscientious grounds, should be allowed. If the matter was pressed, it would only lead to trouble, for he should not serve or consent to his name being entered to serve. The mayor was afraid the exemption might be used by others as a precedent. However, after consulting with one of his officials, he allowed the objection, and the brother had no further trouble in the matter. The brother to whom we are indebted for these particulars recommends that any brethren who may be called upon in a similar way, should follow this example and talk the matter over amicably with the mayor or other officials, as he thinks this course more likely to obtain the desired result than a simple refusal to serve.</p>

<p>
<em>Is a brother breaking the law of God who holds the office of a police constable?</em> – A. T.</p>
<p>
<span class="SmallCaps">Answer</span>. – The office of police-constable involves the employment of personal violence. In this respect, it is on a footing with the calling of a soldier. Our duty in relation to both must be determined by the more general question of whether the servants of Christ are permitted to use force in either the punishment of evil doers, or the protection or vindication of themselves. For if they are not allowed to do this for themselves, it cannot be that they are at liberty to do it for others, as in the case of a soldier or policeman who is hired. The reasons given last month are to us sufficient to decide the question in favour of non-resistance under all circumstances.</p>
<p>We are permitted to escape from evil, as: “When they persecute you in one city, flee ye to another” <span class="Ref:Matthew 10:23"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt.%2010.23" data-reference="Matt. 10.23" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Matt. 10:23</a></span>.) or to accept the protection of the constituted authorities, as when Paul sent word to the Roman captain of Jerusalem of a plot against his (Paul’s) life (<span class="Ref:Acts 23:17"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Acts%2023.17" data-reference="Acts 23.17" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Acts 23:17</a></span>; or to avail ourselves of the law where it affords shelter without hurting our enemies, as when Paul, uncondemned, made use of his Roman citizenship to escape scourging. – (<span class="Ref:Acts 22:25"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Acts%2022.25" data-reference="Acts 22.25" data-version="kjv1900" data-purpose="bible-reference">Acts 22:25</a></span>.) That which appears beyond our liberty at present is the resort to any mode of defence or vindication which involves the subjection of others to violence at our hands. If this be so, a brother is clearly excluded from those occupations which require him to employ this violence.</p>
<p>A police-constable is truly a guardian of the peace, but only in the same sense as a soldier. He is so by possessing (and if need be exercising) the power to repress disturbers by force. The saint will use this power effectively in due time; but it is obvious while the time lasts during which for his trial he is forbidden to use the sword, that he is not in his place as an instrument of force in the hands of the powers that be.</p>
<p>Where there is doubt, it is best to be on the safe side. Whatever difference of opinion there may be on the subject, no one will deny that the passive position contended for is the safe one. Christ will never condemn us for abstaining from all forms of violence for fear of breaking his commandments, even supposing it were to turn out that we were at liberty to use some of them; whereas we should stand in a dangerous position if we had to be told that we had habitually done what was forbidden by the law of the Master, even if it could be added that we thought we were doing right. There are servants to be beaten who knew not their Lord’s will and did things worthy of stripes. Hence the great care that is necessary to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>But the truth may find a man a soldier or a constable. What is he to do? If he can leave the service or the force, let him do so, and find his livelihood in ways more consonant with the calling wherewith he has been called. If he cannot, let him at least, in his calling, act on the principle of absolute harmlessness which belongs to the present Lamb-stage of our heavenly vocation. He will be disqualified for some of the duties of his office; but it may be that in the kindness of God, he may never be called upon to perform them.</p>
<p>
<em>Would you fellowship a brother holding the office of constable?</em> – <span class="SmallCaps">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p>Not if he taught rebellion against the Lord by contending that a brother might lawfully thrust at another with a cutlass, or knock a man down with a truncheon, or kill him in self-defence. If, being found by the truth in a constable’s office, he accepted and strove to obey the prohibitions against personal violence imposed by the truth, seeking peacefully to exercise the harmless duties of his office, duty and mercy would require his recognition at the hands of the brethren, leaving the Lord to judge the doubtful part of the case.</p>
<p>A brother joining the police-force would be in a different position. He would go into the snare with his eyes open, and would rightly forfeit the approbation of his fellow-believers, and incur the possible condemnation of the Lord.</p>
