<p>The responses in behalf of Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Robertson</span>, of Turriff, amount in all to seven.</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge a further contribution of £1 toward the expenses of fitting up the Athenæum, Birmingham, for the service of the truth.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Aberdeen</span>. – Writing on the 24th of December, brother <span class="SmallCaps">Gill</span> announces another immersion, which took place two days before the date of his letter, the subject being the wife of Brother W. <span class="SmallCaps">Gill</span>, of Fraserburgh, at which place there are now three in the truth.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Birmingham</span>. – During the past two months, there have been three additions by immersion, the subjects being <span class="SmallCaps">William Allen</span> (39), joiner, formerly a Methodist; Mrs. <span class="SmallCaps">Smith</span> (36), brought up in “the church;” and <span class="SmallCaps">William Davis</span> (21), son of Brother T. <span class="SmallCaps">Davis</span>. The ecclesia has also received an accession by the removal of brother W. J. <span class="SmallCaps">Turney</span>, from Nottingham to Birmingham.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Christadelphians on the Continent</span>. – Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Hayes</span>, who has, with his wife and sister, been travelling on the Continent for some time, writes as follows from Jersey, on the 18th of December: “I am happy in being able to report myself arrived in this part of the world after an absence of about four months. We reached London on the 30th of last month, and were there a fortnight, meeting with the brethren … In the course of our wanderings, we visited the Seven-hilled City, and saw the reigning Pontiff twice. On both occasions we were very close to him. His appearance impresses a stranger very favourably. One can hardly look on his mild, benevolent countenance and imagine he is the author of such documents as those lately issued from the Vatican. While in Rome, I sought for some sign that its overthrow is near at hand, but could discover nothing. All is perfectly tranquil. The faithful drop on their knees as the Pope drives by, but beyond this, no notice is taken of him, and no public feeling manifested either for or against him. I am anxiously watching the news now that the French troops have left His Holiness to his own resources. Surely the time of our redemption draweth nigh.”</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Edinburgh</span>. – Writing on the 10th of December, brother <span class="SmallCaps">Ellis</span> says that the public meetings of the brethren for the proclamation of the truth, continue with encouraging results, though the audiences are not large. He mentions brethren <span class="SmallCaps">Smith, Paterson</span> and himself as the speakers, and states that the ecclesia is “happy, harmonious and united.” He announces the death of Brother W. <span class="SmallCaps">Oliver</span>, who fell asleep at the age of 21, remarking that young as he was, his apprehension of the truth was “distinct, comprehensive and decided.”</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Galashiels</span>. – Writing on December 19th, brother W. <span class="SmallCaps">Milne</span> says: “I have much pleasure in stating that my daughter Anne (16) has cast in her lot with the small number here, who are “earnestly contending for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.” She was immersed on the 19th current. She has been for a good while past diligently searching the word of life for its hidden treasure. I need not say that it gave me great delight to assist her. Unlike the folk in Dundee, I made it a matter of the first importance to instil into her mind a correct idea of the Scriptural doctrine of eternal life. While I led her to those Scriptures which teach that immortality can only be obtained through union with Christ, I took care that she understood her present mortal condition, “In Adam all die;” “In Christ all shall be made alive.” I was careful that she understood what was “involved” in these two statements; for I am more than ever satisfied that the life in Christ cannot be understood unless the death in Adam is understood also.”</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Halifax</span>. – Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Shuttleworth</span>, writing January 21st, announces the obedience in immersion, of <span class="SmallCaps">Joseph Firth</span>, of Rochdale, lately from America. He also remarks: “The lectures are still going on, and, God willing, are likely to do so. One brother has paid for advertisements in the two Halifax papers for six months to come, and we get reports in every week. The attendance varies; sometimes only a few come; at other times, there is a tidy room-full. This fluctuation arises from several causes, such as varying degrees attraction in the subjects, changes in the weather, and occasional counter attractions elsewhere. But more anon. Our salvation nears. Meanwhile, let us fight valiantly, sow bountifully, and endure patiently.”</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">London</span>. – Brother D. <span class="SmallCaps">Brown</span>, of London, writing on the 14th of December, announces the immersion, on the previous Sunday, of the wife of Brother Aspin, meeting in fellowship with him; and her addition to the ecclesia.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">New Barnet</span>, (London.) – Brother J. J. <span class="SmallCaps">Andrew</span>, who resides at this place, delivered two lectures in the local Temperance Hall, on Tuesday, January 1st, and Tuesday, January 8th; subjects; first, “The second appearing of Jesus the Christ in relation to believers of the gospel, the Jews, and the world at large;” second, “The gospel and the kingdom as revealed by Moses and the prophets, and proclaimed by Jesus the Christ, and his apostles.” The lectures were given by way of reply to three delivered in the same place about six weeks before, by an Irvingite evangelist, who, as usual, encumbered what little truth he uttered, with a great deal of the nonsense peculiar to that section of the apostacy. Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Andrew’s</span> object was, of course, to embrace a favourable opportunity for discharging his duty as a witness of the truth to the neighbourhood in which he resides. The meetings were fairly attended considering the unpopularity of the subjects treated. At the close of each lecture, considerable discussion ensued, Baptists, Methodists and Plymouth Brethren taking part. Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Andrews</span>, each night, distributed slips containing references to the scriptures quoted under the several heads of the lectures. These we shall publish next month, not having room this month. He remarks, “Whether any good, will come of it or not I cannot say. I have not much hope of any becoming interested sufficiently to embrace the truth, for this is rather barren ground. (And where is it not barren? Cheer up, brother Andrews; we know not which shall prosper, this or that. – <span class="SmallCaps">Editor</span>.) Nevertheless, I am glad to have had the opportunity of publicly proclaiming it in the place where I reside.”</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">New Zealand</span>. – We have five letters from this part of the world, reporting a surprising and encouraging state of activity in the neighbourhood of Dunedin and Greenisland in relation to the truth. Several have been immersed, and many are enquiring. In one district, one minister is said to be on the point of having to lament an “occupation gone,” through the defection of the people from orthodoxy to the truth. These results are consequent upon the labours of one who has already been introduced to the notice of our readers, <span class="SmallCaps">John Graham</span>, who is reported to exhibit great energy and enterprise in the cause of the truth in the way of speaking and distributing books.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Swansea</span>. – Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Goldie</span>, writing on Dec. 14, announces the immersion on the previous Monday evening, in Swansea, of Mr. <span class="SmallCaps">Thomas Randles</span>, master shoemaker, and his wife, and also Mr. <span class="SmallCaps">George Dell</span> and his wife, in all four souls, whose addition to the ecclesia is a welcome and refreshing event. Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Dell</span>, formerly camped among the Campbellites; brother <span class="SmallCaps">Randles</span> was connected with the Independents. The same letter conveyed an invitation to the Editor to revisit South Wales during Christmas holidays. This invitation was accepted, and the Editor delivered two lectures in Swansea and four in Mumbles to audiences of fair dimensions. Since that time, the brethren in Swansea have been deprived of their place of meeting in consequence of its engagement by a larger and more “respectable” body. They are on the outlook for another.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Turriff</span>. – Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Robertson</span>, writing under date December 19, reports a visit to Feterangus and Crimond, at the close of October and the beginning of November, resulting in arrangements being made for a second visit in December, which commenced on the 14th day of that month. On the 16th two were assisted in obedience to the faith. viz., <span class="SmallCaps">Alexander Tarves</span>, police constable, Crimond, (formerly connected with “the Reformation” in Fraserburgh, who after two or three years investigation, has come to the persuasion of the truth), and Mrs. <span class="SmallCaps">George Campbell</span>, wife of Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Campbell</span>, of New Pitsligo. Brother <span class="SmallCaps">Robertson</span> mentions that there are several others of whom hope is entertained that they will ere long become obedient.</p>
